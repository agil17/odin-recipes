    <h1>Stop Thinking So Much!</h1>
    <p>When you're in and out and on go, a meal prepped garbanzo salad for 
        the week is just what you need, don't think about it, just grab it and go.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>garbando</li>
      <li>tomato</li>
      <li>jalapeno</li>
      <li>onion</li>
      <li>bell pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook your garbanzo, if canned, rinse and dry garbanzo beans with napkins</li>
      <li>dice your vegetables</li>
      <li>mix garbanzo and diced veggies</li>  
    </ol>
    <p>I like to eat this at home already prepped out, I'll just add mayo, seasoning, and a little bit of lemon
        juice. I'd eat it along with saltine crackers.
